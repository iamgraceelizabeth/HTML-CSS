				<h2>Education</h2>
					<p id="indent">I am a homeschooled 14-year-old that takes classes at Johnson County Community
					College (JCCC). JCCC is located at 12345 College Blvd, Overland Park KS. I have already
					completed an intro to python course at JCCC and am in the middle of and HTML and CSS class.</p>

				<h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
					<p class="padding">I have taken Taekwondo lessons and earned my black belt. I am a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol cadet 
					program (also known as CAP) as well. CAP is the Air Force's auxiliary as well as a non-profit organization. My rank in CAP 
					is Senor Airmen. These two activities have a lot to do with leadership and character building. In both you learn to respect 
					your elders and or people that are higher in rank than you. Taekwondo teaches you a lot about controlling your emotions, leadership, 
					and keeping a level head. CAP helps build your character and leadership skills as well. CAP teaches about qualities that 
					most great leaders have and how to implement those qualities in your life.</p>
				<h2>Work experience</h2>
					<p class="padding"> The work experience I have is caring for someone else's dog.</p>
