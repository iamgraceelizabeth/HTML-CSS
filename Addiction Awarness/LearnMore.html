      <h3 id="opioids">Opioids</h3>

<!-- opioid info start -->
      <p class="centerP">Prescription drug abuse is the use of a prescription medication in a way not intended by the prescribing doctor. It generally takes a couple of weeks to become physically dependent on an opioid, but it varies by individual. </p> 
      <p class="centerP">So what are opioids?<br>Opioids are a part of drugs that are naturally found in the opium poppy plant and they usually provide a variety of effects to those who take them, such as the relief of pain. Opioids can be referred to as illegal drugs or painkillers.</p>  
      <p class="centerP">The most commonly used opioids are prescription opioids like OxyContin, Vicodin, or Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 - 100 times more potent than Morphine and Heroin, an illegal drug.  </p>
      <p class="centerP">Using prescribed medications regularly can increase one’s tolerance or dependence which lead to needing higher and more frequent doses of it. Misusing these drugs can lead to overdose, which can lead to death in some cases. High intake of these drugs can also increase the risk of respiratory depression (slowing or stopping of breathing). The risk can also increase if someone is taking other medications that interact with the drug or if they’ve never taken an opioid before. </p>
      <p class="centerP">When being prescribed a medication be sure to research the effects and information on it and disclose past or present drug use with your doctor to see if a prescription opioid is a good option for you. Make sure to follow all treatment instructions to keep yourself and your community safe. </p>

      <h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>
      
<!-- alcohol info start --> 
       <p class="centerP">Alcohol abuse is the second most common form of substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is when one consumes alcohol in mass quantities regardless of the consequences. When you have an alcohol addiction it is often referred to as alcoholism. If you have alcoholism, you are not alone; <section id="statistic">around 10% of adult men and 5% of adult women have an alcohol use disorder.</section></p>
      <p class="centerP">When a person's drinking causes harm and distress, it is classified as an alcohol use disorder. Alcoholism can lead a person into trouble with their health, home, work, school, and the law. Many that are coping with the disorder have the inability to stop even if they know of the consequences to their relationships and health.</p>
      <p class="centerP">Drinking without moderation can seriously injure the liver, stomach, heart, brain, and nervous system. Heavy drinkers may not be eating enough which leads to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
Women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer and osteoporosis. The risk of mouth and throat cancer is heightened as well.</p>
      <p class="centerP">Early signs of an alcohol use disorder are drinking more than planned, continuing despite others' concerns, and frequent attempts to cut down on consumption. Those with alcoholism develop a tolerance to alcohol and have to drink more to get the desired feeling or just to get intoxicated. When one gets dependent on alcohol, but can't get any they experience withdrawal that includes headache, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and fatigue. As the abuse worsens the person can lose control like having blackouts, or memory loss even though they were conscious at the time. Personality changes can occur too, and relationships can be harder to hold onto.</p>
      <p class="centerP">Those with close family members who have alcoholism places that person at a higher risk of falling prey to addiction. Most experts believe that your risk of alcoholism comes from a mix of genetic and environmental factors. What people with this disorder have to keep in mind is that they are their own person, and while they're drinking if they start to feel negative about it, they need to step back and try to set limits. If this doesn't work there are many organizations that will be willing to help, like the ones below:</p>

      <h3 id="tobacco">Tobacco</h3>
<!-- Tabacco start -->
      <p class="centerP">Tobacco is probably the most widely known, and most abused substance in the world. All tobacco products are extremely addictive due to nicotine: a highly addictive chemical compound found in tobacco plants. The use of any tobacco products can lead to nicotine addiction. One can get addicted to nicotine because it changes the way one's brain works making one crave it. Some products are designed to send the nicotine straight to the brain in seconds, which makes addiction easier to continue and harder to quit.</p>
      <p class="centerP">Nicotine causes a rush of adrenaline when absorbed into the bloodstream. It also increases dopamine (the brain's happy chemical). Dopamine is stimulating the area of the brain that has to do with pleasure and reward. 
      </p>
      <p class="centerP">This type of addiction can't be hidden as well as others. A big factor in this is that tobacco is legal, and can be easily acquired. Some people can smoke occasionally, but others can't and become addicted. Someone with this addiction may:</p>
      <ul class="centerP" class="centerUl">
        <li>Try multiple times to quit but can't</li>
        <li>Have withdrawals when they try to quit</li>
        <li>Smoke or chew after every meal or after long periods of time where they haven't </li>
        <li>Need tobacco products to feel normal or turn to them in times of stress</li>
        <li>Not attend events and gives up on activities that wouldn't allow smoking or tobacco</li>
        <li>Continue smoke disregarding health issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="centerP">Tobacco use can cause lung, throat, and mouth cancers, as well as heart disease, stroke, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema and bronchitis. There are many other problems as well, like gum disease. Secondhand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease.</p>
      <p class="centerP">There are many different options for physical treatments including the patch, nicotine gum, spray, inhaler, or medications. The patch, also known as nicotine replacement therapy(NRT), is a bandage-like sticker that goes on your arm or back to deliver low levels of nicotine to the body, helping wean a person off of it. Nicotine gum is another NRT that helps people who need to do something with their mouths like they would when smoking or chewing. The gum gives small doses of nicotine to help manage cravings. A spray or inhaler can give low doses of nicotine without tobacco use. Medications like certain antidepressants help manage cravings. A commonly used medicine is varenicline (Chantix); some doctors prescribe bupropion (Wellbutrin), which is an antidepressant used off-label because it can decrease your desire to smoke. There are also psychological and behavioral treatments including hypnotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and neuro-linguistic programming that affect the user's thoughts about addiction. They work to change feelings and behaviors that a person's brain associates with tobacco use. Treatment requires a combination of methods, and not all types will work the same for everyone.</p>
