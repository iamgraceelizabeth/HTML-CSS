      <h3>So, what is addiction?</h3>
      <p>Addiction labels the compulsive need for a habit-forming substance or the need to continue a behavior. On this website, we will focus on substance addictions. Addiction is a form of mental illness. Most evident in addiction is dysregulated behavior; in other words, the inability to regulate consumption. A person coping with an addiction could face the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unstability when away from the substance</li>
        <li>Lack of self-control</li>
        <il>Have an increased desire for the substance</il>
        <li>Dismissal or no acceptance that their behavior may be causing problems</li>
        <li>A lack of an emotional response</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
      <p>Addiction is a very real thing and it has big impacts on the people and community around us. It affects physical, mental, and emotional health. It ruins relationships, many peopleâ€™s work and school lives. It contributes to crime and violence rates, and also causes financial problems, housing issues, and even homelessness.</p>
