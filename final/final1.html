				<h2>Who is Tim Berners-Lee?</h2>
					<p>Tin Berners-Lee is a British 65-year-old software engineer that invented the World Wide Web and HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). He was 
					working at CERN when he came up with the idea of a global network system. Berners-Lee is credited for creating the world's first web
					browser and editor. In 1999, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most Important people of the 20st century. He founded the ‘Word Wide
					Web Foundation' in 2009 and directs the ‘Word Wide Web Consortium’ (W3C), which is an organization that looks after the World Wide Web. He
					is the director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI). He is also a member of MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, and an elected
					member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He is a professor in the computer science department at the University of Oxford.</p>

					<p>Tim Berners-Lee was born Wednesday June 8th, 1955 in London to Mary Lee-Woods and Conway Berners-Lee.  He was one of four siblings. His love for
					computing and science shown through at a young age. A big part of Tim’s passion for computers came from his parents who, were keen mathematicians that
					worked on the world’s first commercial computer—the Ferranti Mark 1. This led to Tim’s fascination with engineering, electronics, and physics. He also 
					was an avid train spotter and had been obsessed with science fiction as a child. He claims that he learnt all about electronics by tinkering with his 
					own model railway.</p>
					<p>Tim-Berners-Lee first attended Sheen Mount Primary School. Then he went to Emanuel School in south London from 1969 to 1973. Afterward, he enrolled
					at the University of Oxford at Queen’s College in 1973. He continued to tinker while at Oxford. He soldered together his own computer terminal from a 
					discarded calculator, broken television sets, and a car battery. He was even barred from the nuclear physics laboratory’s mainframe for using it while 
					unauthorized to do so. He had already started devising his own computer languages by this time. He graduated the University of Oxford with a first-class
					degree in physics in 1976.</p>
				<h2>After college</h2>
					<p>After he graduated college, he went on to work for two years at Plessey Telecommunications, one of Britain’s major telecommunications firms, as a software
					engineer. While there he worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. In 1980 he then moved to working at D.G. Nash, a 
					printing company, in Ferndown, Dorset that was run by two friends, Dennis Nash and John Poole. He created typesetting software for printers and wrote a multitasking
					operating system while there. Afterwards, he worked as an independent contractor for a year and a half, including a six-month stint in 1980 with The European Organization
					for Nuclear Research (CERN), located right on the border of France and Switzerland in Geneva, from June through December ending in 1981.</p>
					<p>While at CERN he had to correlate a large amount of research carried out by separate teams documenting work on incompatible systems, so the solution he made was “Enquire”.
					Enquire, written in the Pascal programming language, was based off the concept “hypertext”, which allowed him to link documents based on single word associations instead of
					the branch like hierarchies of existing systems. He urged his associates at CERN to try it, but there were few takers.</p>

					<p>Tim Berners-Lee went back to Dorset for three years to run the technical side of John Poole’s Image Computer Systems LTD. Work at the company included real time control firmware,
					graphics and communications software, and a generic macro language. Then, in 1984 CERN offered Tim a fellowship to work on distributed real time systems for scientific data acquisition
					and system control. When he arrived back at CERN the need for a flexible system of sharing research documents was even greater. At the time the internet, a rudimentary network developed
					by the Pentagon since the 1960s, was being adopted by researchers worldwide for exchanging plain text messages through mail groups. Finding information over the internet was not easy
					because requests for info had to be sent from one user to another and replied to individually. Tim imagined combining the Internet with linked hypertext documents to provide an open-ended
					body of interactive information, so in March 1989 he proposed “Information Management: A Proposal” to his boss at the time Mike Sendall. Mike wrote “Vague but exciting” on its cover but 
					it was never an official project at CERN. Mike managed to give him time to work on the on the project in 1990 and with the help of one of his colleagues at CERN, Robert Cailliau, he produced
					the first version of the world wide web, first web browser, and web server.</p>
				<h2>The Early Web</h2>
					<p>He published the world’s first website online with the address “Info.cern.ch” on August 6th, 1991. It acted as both a website and web server. It contained info about the project so users 
					could learn about hypertext and how to build a web page. This first website and server were run on a NeXT Computer at CERN. The essential elements that made the that made this project work 
					were Uniform Resource Locators or URL’s, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The URL was a universal system for recognizing the location of web pages. HTML
					is how web pages are published and formatted. HTTP is for transmitting documents. It standardizes communication between web servers and the client program, or browsers used to view it from.</p>
					<p>In 1992 there were 50 web servers and in 1994 there were over two million users with 150,000 added every month. In addition, in 1994 the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded at the 
					Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, which later in 2003 merged with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to become the Computer 
					Science and Artificial Laboratory (CSAIL). Tim Berners-Lee has been the director of the W3C since its foundation. The W3C is made up of companies that wanted to work together to create web
					standards and improve the web. It was agreed early on that the technology would remain free of royalties and patents. The Consortium has host sites located at MIT, ERCIM in Europe, and at Keio
					in Japan as well as offices all around the world.  In 1995 Microsoft produced the first version of Internet Explorer creating enormous growth in websites and users. In 1997 the web was first used
					for e-commerce.</p>
