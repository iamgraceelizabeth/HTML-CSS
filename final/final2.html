				<h2>Later Career</h2>
					<p>In 1999 Tim Berners-Lee became the first holder of the 3COM Founder’s chair and wrote a book along with Mark Fischetti called “Weaving the Web: The Original
					Design and Ultimate Destiny of The World Wide Web.” He received many orders including OBE, knighthood, and Order of Merit–-becoming one of the only 24 living members
					entitled to the honor. He was knighted in 2004 “for services to the global development of the Internet.” He also in 2004 was named a professor in the Computer Science
					Department at the University of Southampton, UK. He became the co-Director of the Web Science Trust, launched in 2006 at the Web Science Research Initiative, to help
					create the first multidisciplinary research body to examine the World Wide Web and offer practical solutions needed to help guide and further its design.</p>
					<p>In 2008 he was the 3COM Founders Professor of engineering in the School of Engineering, along with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering
					and Computer Science at CSAIL, where he heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG). He also in 2008 he founded and became the director of the World Wide Web Foundation&mdash;
					a non-profit organization devoted to achieving a world where all people can use the Web to communicate, collaborate, and innovate freely. The World Wide Web Foundation funds and
					coordinates efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.</p>
					<p>In 2009 it was announced by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown that Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt would be working with the UK government to make data more publicly
					available to people that needed it on the website “data.gov.uk”. In 2011 he was named to the Board of Trustees of the Ford Foundation, a globally oriented private foundation
					with the mission of advancing human welfare. In 2012 he was recognized for his invention of the World Wide Web in the 2012 opening Olympic ceremony and joined the Computer
					Science Department at the University of Oxford as a professor in 2016.</p>
